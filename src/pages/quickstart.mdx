# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the SentryPeer API. We'll cover how to get started and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the SentryPeer API, you will need to grab your client credentials. First, create an API client under [Settings](https://sentrypeer.com/settings), then copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the API client's overview page. You will need these credentials to get your access token. Please see our [Authentication](/authentication) guide for more information.
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In the following examples, we'll be using the curl command line tool. You can use any HTTP client to make requests to the SentryPeer API.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

</CodeGroup>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the SentryPeer API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the **Phone Numbers** endpoint.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/api/phone-numbers/:phone-number">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://sentrypeer.com/api/phone-numbers/01414960000 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/phone-numbers"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the Phone Numbers endpoint"
  />
</div>
