# Honeypot Events

Events from our honeypots and yours are what drives SentryPeer — they are the basic building blocks of all SentryPeer data. We'll look at how to send events messages. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
    You can only submit honeypot events to SentryPeer if you are on the [Contributor Plan](https://sentrypeer.com/pricing). Only you can query your own events and they do not form part of the SentryPeer data set, so there is no risk of poisoning our data. It's also much easier to run an official [SentryPeer node](https://sentrypeer.org).
</Note>

## The event model

The event model contains all the information about a SIP probe that a honeypot detects. You can see a full example in the [SentryPeer node docs](https://github.com/SentryPeer/SentryPeer#json-log-format). It is a JSON object with the following properties:

### Properties

  <Property name="app_name" type="string">
    The name of the application that sent the event.

  <Property name="app_version" type="string">

  </Property>
  <Property name="event_timestamp" type="string">
    The timestamp of the event.
  </Property>
  <Property name="event_uuid" type="string">
    The UUID of the event. This is validated as a unique identifier and valid UUID.
  </Property>
  <Property name="created_by_node_id" type="string">

  </Property>
