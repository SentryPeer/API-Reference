# Phone Numbers

Phone Numbers are what we are really interested in at SentryPeer — they are the phone numbers fraudsters try to call to see if they can get an external line for a low cost test call **before** revealing their money making expensive phone numbers. On this page, we'll look at how to query them. {{ className: 'lead' }}

    This endpoint allows you to query a phone number. If you have set up any [alert integrations](https://sentrypeer.com/integrations),
    you will receive an email, slack message or SentryPeer webhook if the phone number has been seen by the SentryPeer honeypots.
