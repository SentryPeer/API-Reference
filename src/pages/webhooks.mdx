# Webhooks

In this guide, we will look at how to create and consume a webhook so that you can integrate your app with SentryPeer. With webhooks, your app can know when an API query finds a match on the [Phone Numbers](/phone-numbers) or [IP Addresses](/ip-addresses) resources. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Create a webhook

To create a new webhook, you need to have a URL in your app that SentryPeer can *POST* to. You can configure a new webhook from the SentryPeer dashboard under [Integrations](https://sentrypeer.com/integrations). Give your webhook a name, set the payload subject and message, and add your URL.

Now, whenever a RESTful API query finds a match (*200 OK*), a webhook is fired off by the SentryPeer platform. In the next section, we'll look at how to consume webhooks.

## Consuming webhooks

An incoming webhook request will contain a JSON payload with the following properties:

```json {{ title: 'Example webhook payload' }}
{
  "type": "sentrypeer_webhook",
  "subject": "Testing from SentryPeer",
  "number_or_ip_address": "Testing SentryPeer Webhook Integration",
  "message": "A match has been found!"
}
```

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="#event-types"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="See all event types"
  />
</div>

---

## Event types

At the moment, there is only one event type: `sentrypeer_webhook`. In the future, we will add more event types to the SentryPeer platform. Please [contact us](https://sentrypeer.com/contact) if you have any suggestions for new event types.

## Security

To know for sure that a webhook was, in fact, sent by SentryPeer instead of a malicious actor, you can verify the request signature. Each webhook request contains a header named `x-protocol-signature`, and you can verify this signature by using your secret webhook key. The signature is an HMAC hash of the request payload hashed using your secret key. Here is an example of how to verify the signature in your app:

<CodeGroup title="Verifying a request">

```js
const signature = req.headers['x-protocol-signature']
const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')

if (hash === signature) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

```python
from flask import request
import hashlib
import hmac

signature = request.headers.get("x-protocol-signature")
hash = hmac.new(bytes(secret, "ascii"), bytes(payload, "ascii"), hashlib.sha256)

if hash.hexdigest() == signature:
    # Request is verified
else:
    # Request could not be verified
```

```php
$signature = $request['headers']['x-protocol-signature'];
$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (hash_equals($hash, $signature)) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

</CodeGroup>

If your generated signature matches the `x-protocol-signature` header, you can be sure that the request was truly coming from SentryPeer. It's essential to keep your secret webhook key safe â€” otherwise, you can no longer be sure that a given webhook was sent by SentryPeer. Don't commit your secret webhook key to GitHub!
